/web/web-data is going away. 
They recommended GitHub pages. using it supports my "learning how to use
     github" goal, as well as potential for learning how I could host a
     personal website (from another gh account, obviously!)

Made a notes repository:
https://github.com/bitterbark/bitterbark_notes

I have to add content before i can do anything.

There is a learning lab, which I staretd. It created another repostory in
     my GH account, 
https://github.com/bitterbark/github-pages-with-jekyll/issues/1
I am trying to follow along with my actual notes while I do this. But it
     migrated code in, where I don't have anything!

So the first thing I need to do is add content. As in, clone the repositroy
     onto my machine.
So made this dir
/home/bundy/Notes_GH/
